        One particular book which is recommended reading is The Street Lawyer by John Grisham. This book is about a lawyer who begins re-evaluating his priorities in life when a bad incident occurs within his law firm.
        Consequently, he becomes acquainted with the inner city streets, and realizes the harsh existence of the
        homeless, and vows to give them a chance in the courts. The Street Lawyer is a great book. It is well written
        and <b><i>interesting</i></b> . Other books by John Grisham include The Firm, The Pelican Brief, and The Client.
